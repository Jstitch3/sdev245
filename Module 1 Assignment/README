# Simple Authentication & Role-Based Access Control Demo (Node.js)

This project demonstrates the core ideas of **authentication**, **roles**, and **access control** in a very simple way.

## How it works
- Users are hardcoded in an object:
  - `alice` → `admin`
  - `bob` → `user`
- On login, the script assigns a role based on the username.
- Two "protected actions" exist:
  - An **admin-only action**
  - A **user-only action**
- Access control logic ensures the right role can only perform the right action.

## CIA Triad
This demo highlights **Confidentiality**.  
Confidentiality means restricting access so that only authorized users can perform specific actions.  
- Admin actions are confidential to admins.  
- User actions are confidential to users.  

This prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive operations.
